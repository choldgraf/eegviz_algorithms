# EEG Viz project
This is a proect for John Chuang's human, sensors, data, and apps class. Its goal is to use the indra client, along with several EEG sensors, to create a cooperative EEG visualization using the brain activity from each user.

The project is broken up into three parts: a 'back-end' set of functions to connect a server with each user's device, a 'front-end' set of functions/classes to perform analysis and extract features on the incoming data, and a 'visualization' component that stitches the previous two components together to do something cool.
